Games and Play Friends and Strangers, 

First off let me say I apologize for the time and effort that has gone into the conversation over a list I created. It’s my deepest and sincerest apologies if this hurt or offended anyone. It was created about two and half years ago and the majority of the additions were by people on the list, their fans or friends. 

This is an open source list and I’ve made little effort to curate it. The only control I have ever exerted over it was to restore it from an older version and lock it down except via form request access after someone hacked and deleted all of the content in it. Also, at the height of gamergate, I set it to invite only viewing status. It has now been re-opened for complete editing access and is once again visible because people kept asking for it to be so. 

I’ve had an amazingly difficult year as have many of us and I would like to move the conversation now to healing and one of growth. 

Why did I make this list? I made it and left it open because often I was told about how few women there were in games. Additionally, the lists of women in games always covered the same women and often I was left with a sadness that none of the rad indie women I knew got coverage. I wanted to tell people about their work and also I wanted to find others like myself. The original list had my NYC friends on it.  I added those 67 friend, none of which were upset by being included and most of which personally thanked me for promoting the community. It was an extremely popular list and many people are proud to be on it. It was tweeted and re-tweeted scores of times for years now. It was my answer to the fact that so few women get funded, PR coverage, Wikipedia pages or support of any kind. It was left open and to the community for that very reason. It was never meant to be anything more than a great resource for people to find creators. 

As creators, we put ourselves in the public eye. I accept that. That comes at a cost. I know there’s a new kind of culture brewing post-gamerate. There’s a sort of vibe of consent now that’s new and as a result of how at risk this group is. That said, all of this info is up on google. None of it is private. Anyone wanting off, for the majority of the list’s life, has been able to remove things. 

However, removal is not consent. I get that. As creators’ no one forces us to have our work online. That’s our personal choice and if someone, a fan or friend, mentions us on a google doc with links to public information we ourselves published where is the line drawn? I’m not sure but I am completely open to this new kind of conversation. 

Since I re-opened editing 6 people have been removed. Six people didn’t want their info put there, several which added themselves and asked after this kind of dialog started of me being transphobic. 

As to that charge, I am deeply offended. As a woman who identifies as queer and has been living openly as a bi-sexual for years that’s beyond depressing. Additionally, I was engaged to a trans women for 3 years. I have been shot at in a hate crime that almost ended my life at the trans / drag / gay bar I worked at for two years. Further, to this day my mother still does not respect my life choices. Even last week I had to face her ongoing dissent of my lifestyle. Try coming out in the deep south in the 80’s. It’s no fun.

Those slurs really hurt. That was totally, completely uncalled for and hate mongering. Please do not talk like that about people you just don’t know.     

Do Anna Anthropy and I not get along? Nope we don’t. We have met in person and like some people, we just don’t like each other. We vibed each other. Do I still support her work? Hell yes. Did I still vote her into Indiecade because she makes great stuff? Yep. Do I support trans women both in my personal life and as creators? Just for the record I’m going to say this in all caps. HELL YES. 

Can you dislike one person and still support a larger group? Guess what, yes you can. 

As for my sham of a career, well doing a Masters in the Sciences at NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering definitely makes me a sham artist. Never trust a scientist. That book I co-wrote on Amazon where I covered the tech bits on computer vision with machine learning and Unity? Total lie. A dude had to write it because I am so feeble minded I could never write my own code. Those academic papers that were peer reviewed that got into Chi and NIME? Ghost written by my cat. She’s actually quite brilliant. This job at Goldsmiths University in Computing? I made it up. I actually work at Hogwarts but I needed an alibi. Some clone that looks just like me teaches my engineering class; it’s definitely not me. Those nearly 2000 women that took the Code Liberation classes? We actually taught knitting and the black art of levitation verses game development.  Shhh. Don’t tell gamergate! It’s the conspiracy they’ve been dying for. 

That said, I want to get serious again. The list I made is open. There are trans and queer women on it who messaged me privately over the past few days in support who did not remove themselves. There are folks here afraid to protest this because they themselves don’t want to be attacked. When a few people freak out and turn into a hate mob, the conversation immediately stops, particularly when you ban someone before they can respond because they live in another time zone and happen to be in bed exhausted and asleep during a weekend. Demanding I answer and do work that I do for free is really not ok, particularly on the weekend. This ruined my Sunday I was so upset. Please keep in mind I’m a real human with feelings. That stuff hurts. It’s really mean. Let’s at least be civil here ok? That’d be really great if we could at least do that.     

That said, I work about 80 hours a week between the CLF and Goldsmiths before we even get to my own games and writing. I’m in the middle of a book and my time is very, very limited. That said, I’ll do what I can to answer when I can. 

As a group, we should support this conversation. I’m just no longer in a position to lead this conversation because now I’m part of the story. Anything I say will come across as hurt feelings. That said, we should talk about internet mobbery going on in games. Developers like myself are exhausted. This just makes doing what we do harder, not easier. The conversation should advance.
